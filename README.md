# CHIP-8 Interpreter
CHIP-8 is an interpreted minimalist programming language developed in the 70’s for microcomputers [COSMAC VIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_VIP) и [Telmac 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telmac_1800). 
It enjoyed relative success during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a popular language for the development of simple video games. Games written in the CHIP-8 language could easily run on systems that had a CHIP-8 interpreter, often mislabeled as "emulator".

*Screenshots*

The graphics of games are flicker because it's the way CHIP-8 designed, but my project includes the ability to reduce flickering by simulating the behaviour of old phosphor displays. 
The pixels of phosphor displays glow for several milliseconds after being turned off which increases the appearance of ghosting.
